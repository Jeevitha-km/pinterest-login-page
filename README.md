ðŸŽ¨ Practicing UI/UX Design: Pinterest Login Page Replication

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest hands-on practice project: replicating the Pinterest Login Page! This project allowed me to refine my skills in UI/UX design while exploring the intricacies of: 

Typography:Ensuring readability and maintaining visual balance. 
Color Schemes:Accurately reflecting Pinterestâ€™s branding. 
Responsive Design:Creating a seamless experience across devices. 

Recreating an existing interface is a fantastic way to dive deeper into design principles and understand user-centric design choices. 

Check out the result below! Iâ€™m open to feedback and discussions on how to enhance it further.
